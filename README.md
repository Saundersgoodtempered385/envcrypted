## The Problem

Every developer has faced this:

```
"Hey, can you send me the .env file?"
"Sure, sending on WhatsApp..."
```

Your secrets travel over chat apps, emails, Slack messages. They get leaked, forgotten, or go out of sync between team members. **envcrypted fixes this.**

---

## How It Works

```
.env  →  AES-256-GCM encryption  →  .env.vault
                                        ↓
                              store locally or push to GitHub
                                        ↓
                              team pulls and decrypts with master key
```

- **AES-256-GCM** with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- **No cloud. No account. No server.**
- Works with any Git repo or just locally
- Detects weak/exposed values with the built-in auditor
- Auto-protects `.gitignore` on init
- Git pre-commit hook to block accidental `.env` commits

---

## Install

Install inside your project — works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** without any PATH issues:

```bash
npm install envcrypted
```

Then run commands using `npx`:

```bash
npx envcrypted init
npx envcrypted audit
npx envcrypted push
npx envcrypted pull
```

### Or add to your `package.json` scripts for convenience:

```json
"scripts": {
  "env:init":     "envcrypted init",
  "env:audit":    "envcrypted audit",
  "env:push":     "envcrypted push",
  "env:pull":     "envcrypted pull",
  "env:generate": "envcrypted generate",
  "env:status":   "envcrypted status",
  "env:doctor":   "envcrypted doctor"
}
```

---

## Commands

### `envcrypted init`
Initialize envcrypted in your project. Generates a master key, sets your storage preference (local or GitHub), and auto-updates `.gitignore` to protect your `.env`.

```bash
npx envcrypted init
```

### `envcrypted push`
Encrypts your `.env` file and saves it as `.env.vault`. If you chose GitHub storage, it commits and pushes automatically.

```bash
npx envcrypted push
npx envcrypted push --message "feat: update API keys"
```

### `envcrypted pull`
Pulls the vault (from GitHub if applicable) and decrypts it back to `.env`.

```bash
npx envcrypted pull
```

### `envcrypted audit`
Scans your `.env` for critical issues and warnings — weak passwords, placeholder keys, exposed DB URIs, HTTP URLs, debug flags, and more.

```bash
npx envcrypted audit
```

**Example output:**
```
── Audit Report ──────────────────────────────────

✖  2 Critical Issue(s) Found:

   Line 3: Weak password (too short)
   → DB_PASSWORD=1234

   Line 7: MongoDB URI with credentials exposed
   → DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://admin:pass@cluster...

⚠  1 Warning(s):

   Line 5: Localhost value — not safe for production
   → API_URL=http://localhost:3000

✔  4 variable(s) look safe.

── Summary ───────────────────────────────────────
   Critical : 2
   Warnings : 1
   Safe     : 4
```

### `envcrypted generate`
Generates a `.env.example` file from your `.env` — strips all values, keeps all keys. Safe to commit publicly.

```bash
npx envcrypted generate
```

**Example output:**
```
DB_PASSWORD=<your-value-here>
API_KEY=<your-value-here>
JWT_SECRET=<your-value-here>
DATABASE_URL=<your-value-here>
```

### `envcrypted status`
Shows a quick snapshot of your project's encryption state — `.env`, vault, `.gitignore`, git hook, and `.env.example`.

```bash
npx envcrypted status
```

**Example output:**
```
── envcrypted Status ─────────────────────────────

✔  Initialized
     Storage  : local
     Version  : 1.1.0
     Created  : 18/03/2026

✔  .env found (6 variables, 0.3kb)
✔  .env.vault found (last updated: 18/03/2026)
✔  .env.example found
✔  .env is in .gitignore
✔  Git pre-commit hook installed
```

### `envcrypted hook install`
Installs a git pre-commit hook that warns if `.env` is unencrypted and **blocks** any commit where `.env` is accidentally staged.

```bash
npx envcrypted hook install
npx envcrypted hook uninstall
```

### `envcrypted doctor`
Runs 8 health checks on your setup and tells you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

```bash
npx envcrypted doctor
```

**Example output:**
```
── envcrypted Doctor ─────────────────────────────

✔  Node.js version: v20.0.0
✔  .env file found
✔  envcrypted initialized
✔  .env.vault exists
✔  .env is protected in .gitignore
✔  Git repository detected
⚠  Pre-commit hook not installed (optional)
⚠  .env.example missing (optional)

✔  Everything looks great! Your setup is healthy.
```

## Workflow

**Team Lead (Project Setup):**
```bash
npm install envcrypted
npx envcrypted init         # generate master key, choose storage
npx envcrypted audit        # scan .env for issues first
npx envcrypted generate     # create .env.example for team
npx envcrypted hook install # block accidental .env commits
npx envcrypted push         # encrypt .env → .env.vault
# share master key with team securely (password manager, etc.)
```

**New Team Member:**
```bash
npm install envcrypted      # install in project
npx envcrypted init         # initialize with same storage type
npx envcrypted pull         # enter master key → .env restored
```

**Check Your Setup:**
```bash
npx envcrypted status       # quick health snapshot
npx envcrypted doctor       # full diagnosis with fixes
```

**Rotating Keys:**
```bash
npx envcrypted push         # enter new master key
# Share new key with team
```

## Security

| Feature | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Algorithm | AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption) |
| Key derivation | PBKDF2 with SHA-512, 100,000 iterations |
| Salt | 64 bytes random per encryption |
| IV | 16 bytes random per encryption |
| Auth tag | 16 bytes (tamper detection) |
| Master key | Never stored anywhere. Only you hold it. |

The encrypted `.env.vault` is safe to commit to public or private repos. Without the master key, it is unreadable.

---

## Add to .gitignore

`envcrypted init` does this automatically. But if you need to do it manually:

```bash
# Always ignore raw .env
.env
.env.*

# These are safe to commit
# .env.vault
# .env.example
```
